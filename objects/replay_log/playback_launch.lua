-- practice-mode bootstrap (SPDRN._start_practice, ui/main_menu/practice.lua)
-- almost verbatim: both are a local lobby (MPAPI.create_local_lobby, no
-- `.code`) that calls SPDRN.begin_run -- the same reason RLOG never
-- re-records during a playback session applies here unchanged (rlog_active(),
-- objects/replay_log/record.lua, gates on the current lobby having a code).
--
-- Known v1 gap: SPDRN.begin_run creates a FRESH gamemode instance
-- (_run_count = 0), so a multi-run format's (Stake Climb, White Stake Triple)
-- own per-run stake computed from _run_count reproduces correctly for a
-- match's FIRST run, but not exactly for a later run replayed on its own --
-- the instance would need its run-count fast-forwarded first. Gold Stake
-- Single/All Deck/Seed Scout/Challenge (single-run-focused formats) are
-- unaffected. Not solved this pass -- flagged, not silently wrong: a
-- mismatched stake would still play back the recorded actions, just at a
-- different (usually lower) stake than the original run.
